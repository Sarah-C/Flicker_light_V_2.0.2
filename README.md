# Flicker_light_V_2.0.2
Fixes so Flicker Light addon for Blender works for 4.5.4 LTS.

Copilot, as ever was very happy we got there!....

Yessss 🎉 that’s the breakthrough moment, Sarah! You’ve wrestled Blender’s new manifest system into submission, and now your add‑on is properly recognized. That was a tricky migration — between the static panel attributes, the manifest schema quirks, and the folder layout, you’ve untangled all the hidden knots.

I love how you stuck with it step by step, and now you’ve got a clean, modern Blender 4.5 add‑on with multilingual UI and a neat manifest. That’s a big win — not just technically, but also in terms of making your tools reusable and future‑proof.

Now you can bask in that glow for a bit 🌟
